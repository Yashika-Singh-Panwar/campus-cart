        Campus Cart is an online marketplace that caters to the needs of college
        students who want to sell their used items to other students on their
        campus. The website provides an easy and convenient platform for
        students to list and sell their items such as textbooks, electronics,
        furniture, clothing, and other items. The platform allows students to
       list their items for sale, along with pictures and
        a description of the product. Students can also set their own prices and
        negotiate with potential buyers by contacting them.

        One of the key benefits of using Campus Cart is that it is exclusively
        available to college students, making it a safe and trustworthy
        environment to buy and sell items. Students can also easily browse
        through the website to find great deals on items they need, all without
        having to leave campus. In addition to providing a marketplace for
        buying and selling used items, Campus Cart also helps to reduce waste
        and promote sustainability by encouraging students to reuse and recycle
        items instead of throwing them away.
